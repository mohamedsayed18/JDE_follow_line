# JDE_follow_line
My solution for [follow-line exercise](https://jderobot.github.io/RoboticsAcademy/portfolio/follow_line/)from [Robotics Academy](https://jderobot.github.io/RoboticsAcademy/)

#### Please Do it yourself
try to do the example by yourself before looking at the solution<br/>
the exercise can be broke down into three tasks<br/>
* color detection
* find the center of an image or shape
* implement the controller (PID, P, PD,...)
